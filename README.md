# Discord bot for badges
This is a project for a discord server that needed a bot to customize and give badges to its members.

## How does it work?
This is a personal project for an specific server so it won't work on anyother server, at least not for now, but I don't have any plans on updating it for more servers.

With ```$help``` command it will teach the user how to use the bot.

I used google sheets for the data base to storage all the members and update new members. The personalized badges are in the database as well so they can be linked with an user using commands.

## Tech used
- Discord.py
- Python version 3.12
- Google Sheets
- VS Code
- Git
- Render for deployment
- UptimeRobot for monitoring
